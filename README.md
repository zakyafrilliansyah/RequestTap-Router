## 🚀 Getting Started with RequestTap-Router

Follow these simple steps to start controlling your API with pay-per-request payments.

### 1. Connect Your API

Inside the app, you will find a straightforward form. Enter:

- The URL of your API.
- The API key or credentials if needed.

This allows RequestTap-Router to access your API securely.

### 2. Set Up USDC Payments

RequestTap-Router works with USDC payments on networks like Ethereum or Skale. You will need:

- A digital wallet that supports USDC (e.g., Coinbase Wallet, MetaMask).
- Some USDC tokens in your wallet.

Connect your wallet through the app. This step lets you manage receiving payments from API users.

### 3. Define Pricing

Set how much each API request costs. You can pick prices based on:

- Number of requests.
- Data size or type.
- Fixed cost per call.

This pricing helps control who can use your API and how much they pay.

### 4. Start the Router

After setup, turn on your router in the app. It will listen for API calls and handle payments automatically.

## 🔧 How RequestTap-Router Works

RequestTap-Router sits between your API and the users (usually AI agents). It checks each API call for payment before letting the request go through.

- When a request comes in, it asks for payment.
- The user pays with USDC.
- Once payment clears, the call goes to your original API.
- The response is sent back to the user.

This process happens instantly and securely, using blockchain technology on the backend but without exposing you to the technical parts.

## 🛠 Features

- **Pay-per-request model:** Only pay when a request happens.
- **Supports major blockchain networks:** Ethereum, Skale, and others.
- **Friendly UI:** Set up quickly without coding.
